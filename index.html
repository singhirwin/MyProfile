<p>Hey, My name is Irwin Singh. I am 22 years old and live in Melbourne.
  I currently work at Carbon Revolution as a Process Operator making carbon
  fiber wheels for Ferrari and Ford.I love to work and learn new skills every
  day at the job. When I'm not working,I spend my time with friends playing
  basketball and cricket at the local clubs. I'm a very outgoing person and
  love to go to new restaurants, concerts, festivals,night outs with mates
  etc. I finished my year 12 in VCAL four years ago and started working at
  Hungry Jack's fulltime. Then two years ago, I completed my Certificate II
  in Electro-Technology but was unable to find an apprenticeship as an
  Electrician. Just a few years later, I was finally able to see myself going
  to uni and decided I wanted to work in the IT industry.</p>
