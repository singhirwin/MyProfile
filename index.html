<p>Hey, My name is Irwin Singh. I am 22 years old and live in Melbourne.
  I currently work at Carbon Revolution as a Process Operator making carbon
  fiber wheels for Ferrari and Ford.I love to work and learn new skills every
  day at the job. When I'm not working,I spend my time with friends playing
  basketball and cricket at the local clubs. I'm a very outgoing person and
  love to go to new restaurants, concerts, festivals,night outs with mates
  etc. I finished my year 12 in VCAL four years ago and started working at
  Hungry Jack's fulltime. Then two years ago, I completed my Certificate II
  in Electro-Technology but was unable to find an apprenticeship as an
  Electrician. Just a few years later, I was finally able to see myself going
  to uni and decided I wanted to work in the IT industry.</p>

<h2>Interrest in IT</h2>

<p>I've always had an interest in IT since I was a kid and always been fascinated
   by the new technology. As a kid, I used to spend hours on the PlayStation and 
   growing up on my phone. I love to explore all the new features and apps in the 
   phone and how it makes our lives so much easier, like from the banking apps to the 
   latest video calling apps etc. I have been working full time after finishing year 12 
   and wasn't sure what I wanted to do. I was unable to go to university after year 12 
   as I didn't have an ATAR which always made me think that university is not for me and 
   I won't be able to do it cause I need a full-time job to support myself. I was 
   exploring some online study options, and my boss told me to check out open universities 
   and how I will be able to study online full time while working full time. So I decided 
   to follow my passion and decided to come out of my comfort zone and take this challenge 
   to learn new skills. I choose RMIT cause it's one of the most prestigious universities 
   in Australia and I would love to study there.</p>


   <h2>Ideal Job</h2>

   <p>I want to become an IT Project Manager one day. What makes this position appealing for me is that it requires in-depth knowledge in the field and fantastic management skills. Requirements for this job are Tertiary qualifications in  Information Technology, Project Management Professional Certification, Strong methodology skills like Agile, Strong business acumen, strategic leadership skills and excellent communication skills. 

    I currently don't have any experience in the IT industry, but I have three years of management skills in the fast-food industry. I plan on gaining technical, teamwork and communication skills through studying a Bachelors of IT at RMIT and hopefully getting an entry-level job in the IT industry.

      <h2>Project Idea</h2>

      <p>My project idea is developing a third party sensor and an app so you can start your car from your house, office or from anywhere else. It will great product helping people to start their vehicles on chilly winter mornings. 
        A few cars these days have this inbuilt, but the vehicles can be costly, and not everyone is available to afford it. I want to develop a sensor which can be connected to your car and also has inbuilt Wi-Fi and 4G sim so you can access that feature anywhere with an app on your phone. It will be an excellent feature for people to warm their cars up in winter and also has an option to turn the heat on. A lot of people when going to work in winter morning can't be bothered to warm the car up for 5-10 mins because they don't want to sit in the cold and freeze so they just start the car and turn the heat on which affects significantly to the cold engine of the vehicle. It can also have a lot of features like GPS tracking of the car in case you forgot where the car was parked and security features like alarms etc. The product would be able to work with both old and new vehicles. With older cars, it wouldn't be able to access some features like turning the heat from your app. With the more modern cars, it would be able to integrate with Apple Carplay or Android Auto. It would be able to use the features with respective voice assistants like Siri or Google Assistant. 
        To make this product, I would have to build both software and hardware. For software, It would require an app and website. The website can be written in HTML along with CSS and probably JavaScript. The app for IOS can be coded in XCode and Swift, whereas an Android app in Java. For hardware, it would require a particular factory with a lot of man power, production factory, grants etc. 
        To build all that software it requires a lot of skills and learn a few different languages to make it available on most operating systems. 
        
        If the project is successful, it will help people around the world to start their cars before getting in it and help keep the engine life longer, which eventually means less maintenance and breakdowns
